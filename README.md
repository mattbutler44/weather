Weather app using OpenWeatherMap API

Feel free to clone this repo. Please note you will need to register for an API key, you can sign up at https://openweathermap.org/api
After you have an API key, open weather.js and navigate to line 3. Change the value of "this.apiKey" to your API key.

While using the weather app, please note that Change Location will prompt for a city and state-- currently you must enter the full state name, i.e. Florida rather than FL.

Upcoming Improvements:
Allow user to choose between imperial or metric units
Allow user to enter 2-letter state abbr. 
Some locations seem to show the wrong time zone- part of Minnesota is thought of as being in the Mountain/Denver time zone
Allow user to add/remove details
